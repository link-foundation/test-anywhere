'test-anywhere': patch

Fix changeset handling to enforce proper workflow: require exactly one changeset per PR with valid type (major/minor/patch) and description, ensure CHANGELOG.md updates on version bumps, create GitHub releases with npm package links, and automatically clean up consumed changesets after release.
