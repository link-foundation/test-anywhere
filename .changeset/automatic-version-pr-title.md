'test-anywhere': patch
---

Add automatic version PR title updates and package-lock.json synchronization. Version bump PRs will now have titles like "chore: version packages (v0.2.2)" instead of just "chore: version packages", and package-lock.json will be automatically synchronized with package.json version updates.
