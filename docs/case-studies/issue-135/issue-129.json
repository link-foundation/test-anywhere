      "body": "## ✅ Issue Resolved\n\nI've completed the analysis and implemented a fix for the extra quotes issue in release notes.\n\n### 🔍 Root Cause Found\n\nWhen the workflow_dispatch manual trigger passes the description `Test patch release (instant)`, the `command-stream` library adds shell escaping by wrapping it in single quotes. This resulted in:\n\n```bash\n# Input: \"Test patch release (instant)\"\n# Command executed: node scripts/instant-version-bump.mjs --description \"'Test patch release (instant)'\"\n# Value received: \"'Test patch release (instant)'\"\n```\n\nThe quotes then became part of the actual value in CHANGELOG.md and propagated to the GitHub release.\n\n### 🛠️ Solution Implemented\n\nImplemented a three-layer defense-in-depth approach:\n\n1. **Primary Fix**: Pass description via environment variable instead of command-line argument (avoids shell escaping entirely)\n2. **Defensive Fallback**: Add quote stripping in instant-version-bump.mjs\n3. **Cleanup Layer**: Improve regex in format-release-notes.mjs to handle escaped quotes\n\n### 📚 Comprehensive Case Study Created\n\nAs requested, I've created a detailed case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-129/` with:\n\n- Complete timeline of events with evidence from CI logs\n- Deep root cause analysis \n- Multiple solution proposals with pros/cons\n- References to GitHub community discussions on escaping issues\n- All CI logs and release data preserved\n\n### 🧪 Testing\n\nCreated experiment scripts to validate the quote stripping logic across various edge cases. All tests pass ✅\n\n### 🔗 Pull Request\n\nSee PR #130 for the complete implementation: https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere/pull/130\n\nThe PR is now ready for review!"
